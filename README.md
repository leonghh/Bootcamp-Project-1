# About

## Santa's Sack - a fun and interactive website

This Project is designed to create a fun and interactive website for kids to tell Santa what they want for Christmas. Eventually it will also include a functionality for parents (aka the real Santa) to see their child/children's Christmas wishlist at a glance, making it easier for them to decide on the shopping list.

Parents will be able to log in to the website and see what their children's Christmas wishlists are, and each selected item will have a link that directs them to the relevant shopping website for immediate online purchase.

## Features

* A stunning Santa's Christmas ranch as backdrop, and Christmas jingles to create a Christmas-y atmosphere
* Countdown timer to Christmas
* Ability to create wishlist tied to each child's name, making it easier for parents at a later stage
* Bestsellers and recommendations based on the selected category for the kids
* Navigation will be easy and intuitive for children, and information will be sorted and made visible only to parents, in order to maintain the "Santa" fantasy for their children

## Tools used
HTML, Materialize CSS, Javascript, jQuery, AJAX for third party API calls.
